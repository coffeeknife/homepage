Hello! I'm Robin, a married butch in my 20s based in Minnesota. I'm a tech nerd, work in the IT sector and
overengineer my stuff at home. I'm a big fan of the old-style web, open source projects and freedom of information.

I also draw and do a lot of crafty stuff. Currently that means bookbinding, but in the past I've done knitting,
sewing, some minimal woodworking, journalling - really whatever catches my attention in the moment.

I might also write about anime and videogames on here. My current anime favorites are Trigun Stampede and Dungeon Meshi.
Recently I've been playing Bugsnax, Subnautica and Terraria. I also play Final Fantasy XIV, which is a whole category in itself.

# About the site

This site is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), which lets me do lots of templating and automation while still keeping the final product
in pure HTML. The theme is custom and specific to this site. The source is available [here](https://github.com/coffeeknife/homepage).
