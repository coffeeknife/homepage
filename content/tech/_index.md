This is a list of my personal/everyday devices. My homelab is another beast and will get its own page.

- **Desktop:** Custom build - i5-12400, Arc A380, 16GB DDR4. Gentoo Linux.
    - performs surprisingly well for how low-end its card is! I usually get 60FPS in FFXIV, and at least 40 in other games. I guess Intel GPUs have the sauce.
- **Laptop:** Thinkpad T510 salvaged from an eWaste bin. 6GB RAM, 500GB SSD. Gentoo Linux.
    - would love to [coreboot](https://coreboot.org/), but I've never done it before and I can't find any guides for my model. (please contact me if you have any advice!)
    - if not coreboot, i just need a regular BIOS mod to take the wifi card whitelist so I can get a modern card in here. if possible, I'd love a wifi 6 card jut for how funny it'd be inside a 2010 laptop.
    - it should be compatible with the FHD 1920x1080 screen from the T530, which would be a lovely upgrade from the 1366x768 it's got.
- **Phone:** Refurbished Galaxy Note20 Ultra. Stock OS, but flashed to remove carrier junk.
    - Samsung DeX lets it work as a mobile workstation in a pinch. I've developed this site from it while plugged into a USB-C dock.
    - Battery life leaves a little to be desired, but it has great sideloading support, a native terminal, and full Clip Studio Paint, so I really can't complain too much. I'm basically always close to a charger anyway.
