Things I use to manage/customize my Arch install. (wip)

- **Software Management:** yay/pacman, flatpak, AppImageLauncher
- **Desktop Environment:** GNOME with extensions
    - **ddterm** - drop down terminal with keyboard shortcut
    - **Dash to Dock** - gives GNOME a dock
    - **AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support** - makes anything reliant on the system tray work
    - **Clipboard Indicator** - straightforward clipboard manager
    - **Arch Linux Updates Indicator** - because arch updates are near-constant
