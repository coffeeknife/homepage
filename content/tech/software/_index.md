Cool programs and services I use every day! Anything with an asterisk (*) is self-hosted, running on my homelab.

## basics
- **Operating System:** [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/)
    - It's a pain in the ass to install, but it has the coolest package system I've ever used.
- **Browser:** [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net) - Fork of firefox without telemetry
- **Editor:** [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) - VSCode without tracking junk
- **VPN:** [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) - one of the only providers I actually trust to be logless
- **Chat:** [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) for Discord and [Cinny](https://cinny.in/) for matrix

## mobile apps (android)
- **Launcher/Customization:** [Nova Launcher](https://novalauncher.com/) and [Kustom Suite](https://docs.kustom.rocks/)
- **Sideloading:** [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) - auto updates apks from github pages
- **App Patching:** [ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) - has a shitload of app patches available. love the youtube patch
- **Discord Client:** [Revenge](https://github.com/revenge-mod) - easy to manage and update, nice plugins. active fork of bunny, which is what i used before

## cloud/sync services
spoilers: I don't trust the cloud
- **Remote Access:** [WireGuard](https://wireguard.com/)* - secure access to my home network from wherever I am. Double-hops to Mullvad.
- **File Sync/Storage:** [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)* - can be a pain to set up, but is basically 1:1 with Dropbox. I also use the todo list and recipe book extensions.
- **Password Manager:** [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)* - works with Bitwarden client apps/extensions.
- **Photo Storage:** [Immich](https://immich.app/)* - an actual godsend. synced 50k photos off my phone easily. good search & facial recognition, too. 

## streaming
- **Music:** Apple Music - significantly better than Spotify. Bigger library. Not yet enshittified. I also mooch and get it free.
    - **Desktop Client:** [Cider](https://cidercollective.itch.io/cider)
- **Video:** [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org)* - Insanely customizable TV/Movie library. I spent hours customizing all the graphics for my shows because it was so much fun. Feels both professional and home-y. If Apple Music goes to shit, I'll use it for music too.
- **eBooks:** [Kavita](https://kavitareader.com)* - OPDS library that's focused on manga. Good web reader.
    - **Mobile App:** [Mihon](https://mihon.app) - works seamlessly.
